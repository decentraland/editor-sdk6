# Decentraland Editor SDK6

This extension includes the following features for Decentraland SDK6 projects:

- **Create projects**: Scaffold a new project of various types: scene, library, portable experience, and smart item.
- **Run scenes**: preview your scenes within VSCode, or launch in a browser.
- **Debug scenes**: set breakpoints, use the debugger to stop/resume execution, see and modify the values of the variables in the scope, step over or step into your code line by line.
- **Publish scenes**: publish your scene to the Genesis City, your own World, or a private/custom server.
- **Manage dependencies**: add, remove, and list the libraries and dependencies that your project is using.
- **Preview models**: you will get an interactive preview when selecting a `.gltf` or `.glb` model.
